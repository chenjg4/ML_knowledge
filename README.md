This place is to log my machine learning study notes.

General process of ML porjects
1. Data Obtaining & Cleaning


2. Data Preprocessing
    Data Cleaning: outlier/missing handling
    Numerical correlation Visuals
    Categorical Encoding
        One-hot Encoding
        Label Encoding
    Scaling/Normalization
        Standardization: z-score based
        min-max scaler


3. Modeling
    Regressioin:
    Classification:
    Time-series:
    Deep-learning:
        Nerual Network
        DNN


4. Evaluation
    Regression: MSE, RMSE
    Classification: logloss, cross-entropy


5. Optimization
    Bayesian optimization
    Optuna
    Loss Functions


6. Deployment
