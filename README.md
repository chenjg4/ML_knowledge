This place is to log my machine learning study notes.

General process of ML porjects
1. Data Obtaining & Cleaning

2. Data Preprocessing
    Data Cleaning: outlier/missing handling
    Numerical correlation Visuals
    Categorical Encoding
        One-hot Encoding
        Label Encoding
    Scaling/Normalization
        Standardization: z-score based
        min-max scaler
